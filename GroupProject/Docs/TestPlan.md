# Test Plan

<!-- *This is the template for your test plan. The parts in italics are concise explanations of what should go in the corresponding sections and should not appear in the final document.* -->

**Author**: Group 54

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy
The strategy implemented for the following test are structured at each milestone through self-design testing utilizing JUnit.

#### 1.1.1 Unit Testing
Developers will test each individual testable portion without combining units, instead isolating each written block of codeÂ and testing it with various test cases using Junit. This enables the early detection of bugs in the application development process. This is the initial milestone to complete. In this phase, we will focus on getting high level of line/function coverage in IDE for each class/activity.

#### 1.1.2 Integration Testing
Testers create multiple test cases that utilize combined units to validate and ensure the functionality of units integrated together are providing the correct results as per the requirement specifications. This is the second milestone to complete.

#### 1.1.3 System Testing
Testers and QA(Quality assurance) test the system specification at full length as a whole in which all units are integrated into combined whole parts. This allows for checking the component interaction with different inputs. The bugs found are logged in Github issues and assigned to the appropriate developer for fixing. This is the third milestone to complete.

#### 1.1.4 Regression Testing
Developers test the application after updates and/or changes to system. This allows for safeguarding the applications from ineffective changes or updates. The bugs found are logged in Github issues and assigned to the appropriate team-member for fixing. This is the final milestone to complete.

### 1.2 Test Selection
Testers will use white-box testing techniques. Testers will start with control flow testing. If time permits testers will add branch testing to add additional coverage.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion
To assess the control flow stage of testing, testers will use Android Studio internal tools to determine code coverage. The goal for code coverage is **80%-90%**. 

If branch testing is preformed, branch diagrams will be created for methods in each class. These diagrams will help determine the total number of branches and the number of executed branches. We can then divide executed branches by total branches to help determine branch coverage.

The instrumented test coverage report from IDE is shown below:

### 1.4 Bug Tracking
Bugs shall be tracked continuously throughout the development of the application and each component by developers. All bugs will be tracked and assigned using the [Github issues](https://github.gatech.edu/gt-omscs-se-2022spring/6300Spring22Team054/issues) for the project repository. After each bug is found, re-testing at each level of milestone will be completed again until bugs are resolved.

### 1.5 Technology
Developers and tester will work together and use Junit to create test cases for each testing milestone to validate and check for defective source code and bugs in the application.

## 2 Test Cases

<!-- *This section should be the core of this document. You should provide a table of test cases, one per row. For each test case, the table should provide its purpose, the steps necessary to perform the test, the expected result, the actual result (to be filled later), pass/fail information (to be filled later), and any additional information you think is relevant.* -->
